## Identifying Research Software Developer Personas Could Create Better RS Developers. Are YOU an RS-10x? 

![epccposter_SLIDE 2024-03-21_1900-1](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/2024-03-28_EPCC-devpersonas/assets/5812129/15e4e000-929f-4d31-ac6b-f57b9353e951)

 

### OPENING:   

Heard the term **'10X developer'?**

**Software engineering** concept: .  .  .  describes a **mythical** person .  .  . **10 times as effective** than rest of dev team...  

Essentially a **'superstar developer'**. 


**I'm Flic Anderson** .  .  . using & writing code for my research  .  .  .  **over 10 years!**  

I **do NOT FEEL like a 10x** developer.   

Often **hard to identify and prioritise**  .  .  .  what should be doing differently 


Imagine if we could  .  .  .  identify the **best development practices** for YOU  .  .  .  based on your **real-world RS data**: .  .  .   **what to change**  .  .  .   to **become 10x**


.


### WHY:

So I want to understand  .  .  .  **how** other people develop RS .  .  .  can we make them **more effective**  

Having names  .  .  .   concepts you want to explore  .  .  .  that's where **developer personas** come in!


.

### WHAT: 

Pilot experiment  .  .  .  **mining REST API** data .  .  .  about features on **github repositories**  .  .  . 


Looking for **clusters of practice**  .  .  .  distinct groups of **interaction**  .  .  .  between developers and repos.  

Starting  .  .  .  **find 'superstar developers'**  .  .  .   in **10 LARGER repos**  .  .  .  with **DOIs** on Zenodo .  .  .  not specific research fields  .  .  .  mixed.        


.


### HOW:
  

Using   .  .  .  **how many** developers  .  .  .  **assigned**   .  .  .  **issue tickets and pull requests**  .  .  .   within these repos. 

Happy to explain  .  .  .  at my poster 


Found .  .  .  amongst repos  .  .  .  which assign at least **some**   .  .  .  issue tickets & PRs
  
  - **~57%** devs **NOT assigned to *either*** category  .  .  . the **RED bar**  .  .  .  mean number commits   .  .  .  **only ~30**.
  
  - **under 20%** assigned   .  .  .  **GREEN bar**   .  .  .  **at least one IT *AND* PR**  .  .  .   but average commit number  .  .  .   **over 350!**   .  .  .  That's a **factor of ten!**
  
  - ~23% remaining developers  .  .  .  1+ **EITHER an IT OR a PR**  .  .  .  but average contributions   .  .  .  still under 50 commits


One group  .  .  .(green bar, assigned 'both')  .  .  .   makes up **minority** of developers   .  .  .  but **majority** of commits

Suggests  .  .  .  **interaction**   .  .  .  we can **start to group**  .  .  .  these developers...  

Could this be  .  .  . foundation of  .  .  .  **'superstar' persona**  .  .  . - **our RS-10Xs?** 


There are  .  .  . some **known drawbacks and limitations** .  .  . to these metrics; 

Can describe these  .  .  .  at my poster. 


.


### NEXT STEPS 

**Identifying and labelling** .  .  .  personas .  .  . from the data. 

Plan to  .  .  . **add more 'properties'**  .  .  . help **separate and describe** these.   

 
**After describing** personas  .  .  .  **test** whether they can **predict**  .  .  . **resulting software effectiveness**

For example by **linking them**  .  .  . to metrics such as **'software quality'**  .  .  .  exploring how **team composition** might affect **usage, popularity or citation**  


.


### CONCLUSION: 

Can .  .  .  **research software developer personas** .  .  .  help create  .  .  . **better RS developers**?

Can they identify .  .  .  what practices would help  .  .  . **make you RS-10X?** 


 **Come to my poster**.  .  . let me know  .  .  . what YOU think .  .  .  makes a superstar RS developer!
