# 3min Lightning Talk Prep 

## Slide Design: SWIPE 

Style:  
  - visually simple, without too much clutter
  - sans-serif font, > 24pt
  - bold for key points and takeaways
  - no animations / video clips / sound    

Words:  
  - 5-7 lines of text
  - 5-7 words per line only
  - ONE IDEA PER SLIDE - signpost ideas, don't use them as notes for my talk   
  - (optional: bitly for the slide? Probably not unless it's a link to the poster in this case)
  - any refs should be readable and at the bottom of the text; no more than a couple per slide or you've got too many ideas in the slide
  - CAPS are read SLOWER than lower case text; also, don't be shouty!  

Images:  
  - Graphs need to be presented SLOWLY, and explained SLOWLY and carefully; the audience hasn't seen it before, the presenter knows it inside out. Give them time.
  - You need to give enough time for audience to take in the content of the plot: explain axes, relationships, (obvs outliers), takeaway.
  - graphs should be uncluttered and as simple as possible
  - ONE per slide tbh
  - use images / photos to break up presentations if there's lots of text/data/dry content and make things relatable.
  - maintain same style of images throughout.  

Palette:  
  - aiming to follow EPCC branding largely (white background, dandelion highlights, epcc navy text/lines, + university red for emphasis/titles.)
  - think about accessibility of content for colour-blindness/screen reading etc  

Extras:  
  - could bring in bulletpoints slide by slide to emphasise each point if there are several and to avoid overloading audience with sudden wall of text



## Talk Prep:  

### Key point I want to get across:  
(come see my poster; my poster is interesting; you will benefit from coming to see my poster)  

### Story of my talk:   

Introduce myself / why am I entitled to talk about this? Give my credentials    

#### Background / why is this relevant to you?:   
Research software research is a recent field  
But almost everyone in research uses or writes research software  
Every researcher I speak to agrees that academic code is usually terrible...  
So why is it so bad? How can we fix it?   
To fix something, you need to know what's going wrong: that's research software research.   

#### Methods: My research goals: 

What are the common RS devt practices? 
(Do they apply to all projects? All developers? All fields of research?)

Focussing on people first - looking at the developers. 
To be able to communicate about something and discuss it, you need to be able to name key concepts and describe it.  
For my purposes, looking for groupings of ways people interact with their RS codebases

Why not talk to them? 
People don't always tell you what they're doing accurately - survey data is intensive to obtain, and a lot of these ideas are complex!

#### Methods: my actual methods:   

What did I do instead? 
Mining data from research software repositories.  
Harder to unpick the 'why' but gives a good idea of the 'what'/'how'. 

Gathered repositories from Zenodo DOI minting service db to get 'repos 

#### Results:  
Key Graph! (or similar graph showing an intriguing result...)  

Assignment distribution:

Average commits per developer by category:

#### Conclusions
Future work: 
Combine developer survey data + repo data to combine 'what' and 'why'!  


#### Concepts I need to make sure I explain:  
  - RS
  - repositories s.a. github
  - issue tickets
  - pull requests
  - assignment categories
  - commits
  - 10x programmer
  - 'developer personas'    
 




### Pause points in my talk:   
  - context  
  - key graph 
  - takeaways   

### Length: aim to finish at 2min 50sec
