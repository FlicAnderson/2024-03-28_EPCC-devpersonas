## Identifying Research Software Developer Personas Could Create Better RS Developers. Are YOU an RS-10x?

### OPENING:   

Have any of you heard of the term '10X developer' before? It's a software engineering concept that describes a mythical person who is 10 times as effective than everyone else on the dev team...  It's another term for a 'superstar developer'.   

I'm Felicity Anderson, and I've been using and writing code for my research for over 10 years!  
I am NOT a 10x developer.   
I have written a lot of bad code in the past for my research, and what I've noticed is that everyone else seems to have done the same...


### WHY:

As a result, I want to understand more about how other people develop RS and whether we can make them more effective at doing it.  

To understand something and talk about it, it helps to have names for the concepts you want to explore - that's where developer personas come in!

Who here writes or has written software for research?  Hands up? 
Hopefully my poster should be relevant to most of you then! :)  


### WHAT: 

My pilot experiment invovles exploring data from features on github repositories for research software  

I'm looking for clusters of practice within the data - distinct groups of interaction between developers and repos.  

In this case, I'm starting by trying to find 'superstar developers'.  


### HOW:

Mining data from research software repositories.  
Harder to unpick the 'why' but gives some idea of the 'what'/'how'.  

Using data on how many developers get assigned to issue tickets and pull requests within these repos. 
I'm happy to explain more about these features at my poster if you're not familiar with what those are.

What I've found in my initial investigation is that amongst repos which DO assign at least some of their issue tickets & PRs to developers:  
  - ~57% of devs are NOT assigned to *either* category, but in terms of mean number of commits to the repos, their average is only around 30 commits. This is the RED bar. 
  - under 20% of devs are assigned to at least one IT *AND* PR, but actually their average number of commits is over 350! This is the GREEN bar. 
  (the ~23% of remaining developers are assigned to one or more of EITHER an IT OR a PR; but their average contributions are still under 50 commits too.) These are the Blue and Orange bars.  

So we have one group which makes up a minority of developers, but the majority of commits...  This suggests there might be some kind of interaction here and we can start to group these developers...  
This could be the foundation of a 'superstar' persona - our RS-10Xs? 


### WHAT IF?   

For those of you using github, or repositories with similar 'development management' features like issue tickets and PRs: 
  - Where do you think you'd fall in that data?
  - Do you have responsibility for lots of items?
  - Do you contribute a lot of activity to the repository? 

Imagine if we could identify the best development practices for YOU, based on how you actually develop your real world projects?  
Imagine if I could tell you what to change to become a superstar RS developer (if you aren't already!)...

The first steps to this are identifying and labelling 'clusters' of practice from the data. 
I plan to add more 'properties' to help separate these clusters:  
  - opening/closing behaviours with ITx & PRs
  - looking at which types of files devs touch in their commits
  - and more  

Once I can identify and describe these personas, I want to try and link them to metrics for 'software quality' and effectiveness, and look at how team composition might affect those measures!  


### CONCLUSION: 

From the work I've done I can clearly see that there's some kind of interaction between assignment data and contribution data.  

We've got the foundations of some groupings starting to emerge; 
Adding more properties from the data and expanding my dataset will help ensure potential personas will be robust enough to form a basis to help find out what changes in practice every RS developer can make to become a superstar! 

Please come talk to me at my poster to let me know what YOU think makes up a superstar RS developer!
