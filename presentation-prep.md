# 3min Lightning Talk Prep 

### Slide Design: SWIPE 

Style:  
  - visually simple, without too much clutter
  - sans-serif font, > 24pt
  - bold for key points and takeaways
  - no animations / video clips / sound    

Words:  
  - 5-7 lines of text
  - 5-7 words per line only
  - ONE IDEA PER SLIDE - signpost ideas, don't use them as notes for my talk   
  - (optional: bitly for the slide? Probably not unless it's a link to the poster in this case)
  - any refs should be readable and at the bottom of the text; no more than a couple per slide or you've got too many ideas in the slide
  - CAPS are read SLOWER than lower case text; also, don't be shouty!  

Images:  
  - Graphs need to be presented SLOWLY, and explained SLOWLY and carefully; the audience hasn't seen it before, the presenter knows it inside out. Give them time.
  - You need to give enough time for audience to take in the content of the plot: explain axes, relationships, (obvs outliers), takeaway.
  - graphs should be uncluttered and as simple as possible
  - ONE per slide tbh
  - use images / photos to break up presentations if there's lots of text/data/dry content and make things relatable.
  - maintain same style of images throughout.  

Palette:  
  - aiming to follow EPCC branding largely (white background, dandelion highlights, epcc navy text/lines, + university red for emphasis/titles.)
  - think about accessibility of content for colour-blindness/screen reading etc  

Extras:  
  - could bring in bulletpoints slide by slide to emphasise each point if there are several and to avoid overloading audience with sudden wall of text
